    [story]
    [part]
    story= _"Thirty years ago Kapou'e Black Eye united the disparate orc clans under his banner. Since then, no ruler had dared to attack the powerful union of clans. The Iron Law of the Supreme Ruler suppressed inter-clan strife. In the united country orcs were multiplying, licking their wounds, establishing new settlements, they were recovering from the great war. But Kapou'e died and the union weakened. The air smelled of the old orcish life."
    [/part]
    [part]
    story= _"A young clan of Straight Blades founded by veterans of the Kapou'e army was located in the southeast of the Union bordering the Barren Plains, where wild nomadic ogres lived. Ogre raids used to be commonplace; they stopped during the Kapou'e era. Unfortunately for the Straight Blades, orcs were not the only ones who grew stronger after the respite."
    [/part]
    [part]
    story= _"Sensing that the unity of orcs was weakening, the ogres gathered a large horde and raided the Straight Blades. Hundreds of hungry, snarling, hooting ogres came under the orcish walls."
    [/part]
    [part]
    story= _"The orcs fought worthy of their ancestors, but the forces were unequal. The Ogres killed all the men, ate the children, and enslaved the women. For three days and three nights, the ogres rampaged through the blood-soaked streets."
    [/part]
    [part]
    story= _"On the fourth day the ogres burned the settlement and went back to their steppes. Their carelessness had played havoc with them. An army of the border Coldblood Clan caught up with the ogre caravan. The enraged orcs brought vengeance at the tip of their blades."
    [/part]
     [part]
    story= _"The Coldblood warriors massacred the ogres. They freed the captives and brought them to their settlement. The chief accepted them into the clan."
    [/part]
    [part]
    story= _"Some time later, one of the former captives gave birth. A huge, ugly child tore open its mother's womb and came into the world. The whole hut was drenched in blood. It was a half-ogre half-orc, a sinister greeting from the past."
    [/part]
    [part]
    story= _"The chief wanted to kill him, but the old orc shamaness forbade him. The spirits told her that the clan must accept this terrible child or great misfortune would befall them."
    [/part]
    [part]
    story= _"Gritting his teeth, the chief agreed. He ordered the shamaness to raise the cursed child."
    [/part]
    [part]
    story= _"The baby was named "Mug," which means "Dirty." Very soon the nickname "Harmful" was added to it."
    [/part]
    [part]
    story= _"Mug the Harmful grew up under the supervision of an orcish shamaness. Very soon he became larger and stronger than many of the orcs, but his bad destiny kept him from taking his rightful place in the orc hierarchy. Mug grew up among the goblins. He shared in all the humiliation that the weak are subjected to."
    [/part]
    [part]
    story= _"But Mug himself was no wimp. Sometimes he fought back against orcs, which made the other goblins look at him as a hero. But Mug didn't want to be a hero to the weak. He grew up to be a strange and vicious creature."
    [/part]
    [part]
    story= _"The years passed. As Mug came of age, war came to the orc lands. The Orc Power clashed with the Northern Alliance. The clans did not understand the reasons for the war. The Supreme Ruler called the Great Horde - and the clans joined in. The leader of the Coldbloods put Mug in charge of a goblin warband."
