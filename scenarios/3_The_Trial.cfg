For years she and Ka'ah had sought to rule the clan according to the will of the spirits, and each time aggressive, thick-headed chiefs had ruined everything. Unlike them, Moog had grown up as Ka'ah's son and obeyed her. Mursha believed that if Moog became chief, their plans would finally come true. Ka'ah agreed with this and told Mursha to help Moog become chief at any cost."
