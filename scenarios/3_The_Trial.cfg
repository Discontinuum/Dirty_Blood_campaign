        story=_ "The old orcish woman hesitated. She knew that Moog was destined to rule, for he had the blood of a noble ogre, perhaps even the Khan of the Ogres himself. That was why she had prevented the chief from killing Moog years ago when he was born. But Moog's cruel nature and his mutual hatred of the greater orcs did not bode well."

        story=_ "But Mursha saw a chance in Moog's ambition. For years she and Ka'ah had sought to rule the clan according to the will of the spirits, and each time aggressive, thick-headed chiefs had ruined everything. Unlike them, Moog had grown up as Ka'ah's son and obeyed her. Mursha believed that if Moog became chief, their plans would finally come true. Ka'ah agreed to this and told Mursha to help Moog become chief at any cost."

No one except Bagul, who set off at sunset to the sacred cave with his gang.  Moog and Mursha had no choice but to try to outrun him."
