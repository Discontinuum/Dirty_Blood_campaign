His battle-hardened army walked the clan's lands like a storm killing the strong, subjugating the weak, installing a new order. When the last strong orc of the Red Fang was eaten by ogres and each settlement got an overseer from the Cold Blood, Moog returned to his capital and announced that he merged all his land into a new clan - the clan of the Stone Hand."

The Council had called the Great Horde for a reason unheard of before: an ancient dragon with his army flew to the Orcish lands and claimed his rights to Haag Mountain. He arranged a time and place for a battle if orcs wanted to challenge this rights. The Supreme Chief accepted the challenge."
